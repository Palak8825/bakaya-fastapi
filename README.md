## The Problem

Large firms run dedicated accounts-receivable desks to chase payments and protect cash flow.  
MSMEs cannot afford one — so the owner does it personally, and then stops doing it to protect the relationship.

| Stat | Figure | Source |
| ---- | ------ | ------ |
| MSME receivables locked in delayed payments (India) | **₹7.34 lakh crore** (Mar 2024) | GAME–FISME–C2FO, *Delayed Payments Report 3.0* (2025) |
| Share owed to **micro & small** suppliers | ~80% | GAME–D&B–Omidyar, *Delayed Payments Report* |
| Formally disputed dues on MSME Samadhaan Portal | ₹22,363 Cr (Jul 2025) | Min. of MSME, Lok Sabha reply |
| Avg. days to get paid — micro enterprise | **176 days** | CMIE Prowess analysis, 2019 |
| Statutory payment limit | **45 days** | MSMED Act 2006, s.15 |
| Udyam-registered MSMEs (eligible for MSMED protection) | **7.83 crore** (Feb 2026) | Ministry of MSME (PIB) |


**The real blocker is fear, not process.** Owners avoid chasing payments to
protect the relationship, so working capital stays stuck for months. Bakaya
steps in as an external AR desk — the system asks, never the owner.

Bakaya earns a **2–5% facilitation fee** on amounts it helps recover. The unit
economics are simple: every ₹1,000 crore of receivables recovered through
Bakaya generates ₹20–50 crore in revenue. Against a ₹7.34 lakh crore market —
~80% of it owed to the micro and small suppliers Bakaya serves — even a
low-single-digit share of recovered receivables is a multi-hundred-crore
opportunity. The near-term wedge is the **0–90 day pre-litigation window**,
where no incumbent operates.

## The Solution

**Bakaya AI** is an agentic system that monitors invoices against the MSMED statutory timeline. It:

- Sends reminders in the supplier's trade language at the right tone for each escalation stage
- Tracks legal interest accruals in real time (deterministically — no LLM involved in the maths)
- Auto-compiles evidence packs for the MSME ODR Portal
- Depersonalises the collection follow-up so the owner never has to ask awkwardly

> *The buyer's cost of stalling just changed.*

### The Escalation Ladder — Worked Example

**Context:** Selvam runs a Tirupur garment unit. A buyer owes ₹1.8L past the 45-day mark.

```
DAY 0    ── Eligibility Check
              Bakaya matches invoice dates against Selvam's Udyam registration
              to confirm the MSMED clock applies (Silpi Industries SC 2021 rule).

DAY 30   ── Relationship-Safe Nudge
              A polite reminder goes out in Tamil, sent under the business name —
              not Selvam's own. No mention of interest or legal action yet.

DAY 46   ── The Tax Nudge
              Statutory interest starts accruing. Bakaya flags the Section 43B(h)
              tax cost to the buyer: this outstanding amount is NOT deductible
              until paid. The buyer now has a financial incentive to settle.

DAY 75   ── Formal Demand
              Bakaya drafts a formal demand notice with exact principal +
              compound interest at 3× RBI Bank Rate. Tone is firm, professional.

DAY 90+  ── ODR Preparation
              Full filing pack assembled: purchase orders, delivery logs,
              interest workings → ready to submit to odr.msme.gov.in.
```

**Why the escalation is credible:** Filing at the MSME Facilitation Council is free for the supplier · the council must rule within 90 days · buyers must deposit **75% of any award** to appeal, so they cannot simply stall.

## Why Not Just Use ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini?

| Capability | Bakaya | Generic LLM |
|---|---|---|
| Statutory interest maths | Deterministic compound calculation at 3× RBI Bank Rate, monthly rests, from day 46 — auditable, reproducible | Unreliable; LLMs hallucinate financial figures |
| Stage-aware escalation | 5-stage state machine with date-driven thresholds; stage-index guard prevents re-sending the same notice | No state; no idempotency |
| Udyam eligibility check | Validates Udyam registration predates the invoice (per Silpi Industries SC 2021) | No domain guardrail |
| Autonomous book sweep | One API call walks every overdue invoice, drafts, sends, logs, and advances stage | Manual, one invoice at a time |
| ODR filing pack | Pre-filled, legally structured PDF with interest workings and escalation history — uploadable to odr.msme.gov.in | Cannot produce a legally correct, case-specific PDF |
| Section 43B(h) flag | Computed per invoice; included in notices automatically when applicable | No integration with Indian tax law triggers |
| LLM's actual role | Tone and language only — numbers are passed in, never computed by the model | Trusted to compute numbers (hallucination risk) |

---

## Competitive Positioning

| Alternative | Gap |
|---|---|
| Vyapar / Khatabook / Zoho | Generic payment reminders — legally blind; no 45-day clock, no interest tracking, no legal leverage |
| CA & legal recovery firms | Upfront fees; engage only after the relationship is already damaged |
| Govt MSME ODR Portal | Starts only when a dispute is filed — nothing addresses the 90-day window before litigation |
| Owner's WhatsApp messages | Solves nothing; the fear of damaging the relationship is the blocker |

**Bakaya's edge:** Pre-dispute automation capturing the overlooked 0–90 day window · depersonalised chasing (the AR desk effect) · per-invoice legal layer no app has · vernacular-first notices in the language the trade actually runs in.

## How It Works — Under the Hood

### Data flow for an autonomous escalation sweep

```
POST /api/escalation/run
  │
  ├─ DB: load all (Invoice JOIN Buyer)
  │
  ├─ rules.py ── get_escalation_stage(invoice_date)
  │     5-stage ladder: none → nudge → tax_nudge → formal_demand → odr_ready
  │     Thresholds: 30 / 46 / 75 / 90 days since invoice date
  │     Pure date arithmetic — no network, no LLM
  │
  ├─ rules.py ── calculate_interest(amount, invoice_date)
  │     Rate    = 3 × RBI Bank Rate = 16.5% p.a. (June 2026)
  │     Method  = compound, monthly rests, starting day 46
  │     Returns = { principal, totalInterest, totalDue, msmedDaysOverdue,
  │                 applicableRate, section43bhApplies }
  │     All Decimal — no float rounding errors in legal amounts
  │
  ├─ Stage-index guard (idempotency)
  │     Only acts if computed_stage_index > stored_stage_index
  │     Re-running the sweep never re-sends the same notice
  │
  ├─ drafting.py ── draft_message(stage, buyer_name, numbers…, language)
  │     Primary:  Groq API → llama-3.3-70b-versatile
  │               Prompt injects pre-computed numbers; LLM writes tone only
  │               Tone per stage: warm nudge → tax alert → formal → final
  │     Fallback: deterministic template (always produces a draft; no API key needed)
  │
  ├─ notify.py ── send_notice(to, subject, body)
  │     EMAIL_MODE=real       → Gmail SMTP (smtplib)
  │     EMAIL_MODE=simulation → console log (safe for demos)
  │
  └─ DB: write EscalationEvent row, advance invoice.escalation_stage, commit
```

### ODR PDF generation

`GET /api/invoices/{id}/odr-pack` builds a downloadable PDF (fpdf2) containing:

- Parties (supplier / buyer contact details)
- Invoice summary (number, date, principal)
- Full MSMED s.16 interest workings (rate, months, total)
- Escalation timeline (every event with date, stage, channel)
- Ready-to-file claim statement citing MSMED Act ss.15–17
- Document checklist (invoice copy, Udyam cert, PO, delivery proof, etc.)
- Recovery priority flag (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW) based on days overdue

---

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario A — Autonomous sweep

**Input:** Three seed invoices all dated > 90 days ago (`python seed.py`).

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8099/api/escalation/run
```

**What happens:**
1. `rules.py` computes `odr_ready` for all three invoices (age > 90 days).
2. Stage-index guard: stored stage is `none`, computed is `odr_ready` → act.
3. `drafting.py` calls Groq; produces a final-notice draft in the buyer's language.
4. `notify.py` logs to console (simulation) or sends via Gmail SMTP (real).
5. Three `EscalationEvent` rows written; all invoices advance to `odr_ready`.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "processed": 3,
  "escalated": 3,
  "results": [
    {
      "invoiceId": 1,
      "invoiceNumber": "INV-001",
      "action": "escalated",
      "fromStage": "none",
      "toStage": "odr_ready",
      "deliveryStatus": "simulated",
      "source": "llm"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why it's useful:** One API call handles the entire overdue book. Re-running the sweep is safe — no duplicate notices.

---

### Scenario B — ODR filing pack PDF

```bash
curl localhost:8099/api/invoices/1/odr-pack -o ODR-Pack-INV-001.pdf
```

**Output:** A ready-to-upload PDF containing:

- Parties and invoice details
- Interest workings: `Rs X principal × (1 + 16.5%/12)^months = Rs Y total`
- Escalation history with dates and channels
- Claim statement citing MSMED Act ss.15–17
- Document checklist (invoice, Udyam cert, PO, delivery proof, bank statement)

---

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env          # fill in variables below
python seed.py                # creates bakaya.db + 3 sample invoices
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8099
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///./bakaya.db` | SQLite (dev) or `postgresql+psycopg://…` (prod) |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | _(empty)_ | LLM drafting — omit to use template fallback (app still works) |
| `EMAIL_MODE` | `simulation` | `real` to send actual emails via Gmail SMTP |
| `GMAIL_ADDRESS` | _(empty)_ | Sender address for real email |
| `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` | _(empty)_ | Gmail app password (not your login password) |
| `DEMO_RECIPIENT_EMAIL` | _(empty)_ | Redirect all outbound notices to one inbox during demos |

### Quick smoke test

```bash
curl localhost:8099/api/dashboard/summary
curl -X POST localhost:8099/api/escalation/run
curl localhost:8099/api/invoices/1/odr-pack -o odr.pdf
```

## Current Status & Honest Gaps

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Buyer CRUD | Working |
| Invoice create / list with live interest | Working |
| Escalation sweep (autonomous) | Working |
| LLM drafting via Groq | Working (template fallback if no API key) |
| Email — simulation mode | Working |
| Email — real Gmail SMTP | Working |
| ODR filing pack PDF | Working |
| Dashboard aggregate metrics | Working |
| Udyam eligibility date check | Implemented in `rules.py`; not yet wired to the UI |
| Owner-approval gate for `formal_demand` / `odr_ready` | Gap — sweep is fully autonomous (demo only; production must gate these stages) |
| Alembic migrations | Not yet — `init_db()` is dev-only; production needs Alembic |
| Bhashini vernacular translation | Planned; `language` field on Buyer model exists; not yet wired |
| WhatsApp Business API delivery | Planned; email is the current delivery channel |
| Tally / Zoho / Vyapar invoice import | Planned; manual entry only in MVP |
